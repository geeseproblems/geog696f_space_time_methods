    "Let's now see how we plot data in a map with a certain projection.  Let's do a simple location plot of Tucson and Flagstaff.  We'll use a `dict` structure to hold these data, but really we can pass any longitude and latitude coordinates to Matplotlib functions like `.plot` or `.scatter`.  The key is to include the `transform=` keyword argument in these.  Sometimes Cartopy figures out automatically what you're trying to do, but in my experience it most often doesn't, so always best to tell it, essentially, 'hey, these are latitude and longitude points on a regular grid' or 'these Geodetic coordinates'.  I confess I'm still not 100% clear on why they designed it this way.  Essentially, the projection determines the map projection, but the `transform` tells Cartopy that you are regular latitude longitude space.  So, the `transform` option that works most of the time is `transform=ccrs.PlateCarree()` (which is apparently just a simple way of saying 'these are regular latitude and longitude points').  Another option is `transform=ccrs.Geodetic()` which works sometimes but not always, but would be needed if you were plotting great circle routes, for instance.   "
