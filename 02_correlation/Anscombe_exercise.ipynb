The first column is simply an id number.  The second column identifies which dataset (I, II, III, or IV) that row belongs to, and the third and fourth columns are the x and y values for that dataset.  Each of the 4 datasets is intended to have a match set of x and y values.  In otherwords, for dataset I, there are 11 values for x and 11 values for y that go together.\n",
